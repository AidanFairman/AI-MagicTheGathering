# Welcome to Magic the Gathering AI page

This monstrosity was a representation of the board state, and there are buttons for most any action you could do.

### Summary

This project was for my Artificial Intelligence class as the final project. The project was required to play one of the decks from the Knights vs Dragons duel deck set. Students had to be familiar with the rules, and could impose penalties on the other team for their AI providing illegal moves. 

Most of the project was getting the environment up and running, which is not pretty in this project. The AI uses the environment and the rules to generate possible moves for every phase, and then evaluate them, providing the player with the best move (as determined by the AI).

The AI performed pretty well in the semester-end tournament. This one was the most accurate for playing the game, but in the end we didn't win. There are games of MTG where you just can't get the draws you need, and we got a couple games like that.

### Try it out!

There is an executable in the [root folder](https://github.com/AidanFairman/AI-MagicTheGathering) which will allow someone to play one deck against another. Field states need to be managed manually, but theoretically, 2 of these could play against one another (if you had physical cards for the sets).
